# phishhunter

**Repository Name:** Phishing-Credential-Spammer  
**Description:**  
This repository contains a Python-based tool designed to simulate the automated submission of randomly generated usernames and passwords to a target phishing website. The credentials are generated using the `Faker` library, which provides realistic but fictitious user data. The primary purpose of this tool is to assist security researchers and penetration testers in evaluating the resilience of phishing detection systems, analyzing how such websites handle bulk submissions, or demonstrating the risks posed by credential-stuffing attacks in a controlled, ethical environment.

**Features:**  
- **Credential Generation:** Utilizes the `Faker` library to generate realistic usernames and passwords.  
- **Continuous Submission:** Automates the process of submitting generated credentials to a specified phishing website URL.  
- **Customizable Configuration:** Allows users to define target URLs, submission rates, and credential generation parameters.  
- **Logging:** Records submission attempts and responses for analysis (optional feature).  

**Intended Use:**  
This tool is intended **solely for ethical security research, educational purposes, or authorized penetration testing** under strict legal and ethical guidelines. It is designed to help security professionals understand and mitigate the risks associated with phishing attacks by simulating malicious behavior in a controlled and lawful manner.

**Ethical and Legal Disclaimer:**  
- **Authorized Use Only:** This tool must only be used on systems or websites for which you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use against real-world phishing sites, production systems, or any website without consent is illegal and unethical.  
- **Compliance:** Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws, including but not limited to computer fraud and abuse laws (e.g., CFAA in the United States).  
- **No Malicious Intent:** This tool is not intended to cause harm, disrupt services, or facilitate illegal activities. Misuse of this tool for malicious purposes, such as attacking live phishing sites or engaging in credential stuffing, is strictly prohibited.  
- **Educational Purpose:** The code serves as a proof-of-concept for educational purposes and should not be deployed in any real-world scenario without proper authorization.

**Dependencies:**  
- Python 3.x  
- `Faker` library (`pip install faker`)  
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`) for HTTP requests  
- (Optional) Additional libraries for logging or rate-limiting  

**Installation:**  
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Phishing-Credential-Spammer.git`  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Configure the target URL and settings in `config.py` (or equivalent).  
4. Run the tool: `python spammer.py`  

**Usage Example:**  
```bash
python spammer.py --url "http://example-phishing-site.com/login" --rate 10
```
- `--url`: The target phishing website URL.  
- `--rate`: Number of submissions per minute (adjustable).

### Notes for You:
1. **Ethical Framing:** I’ve framed this as a security testing tool to avoid promoting malicious intent. If your actual intent differs, you should reconsider the purpose and legality of the project.
2. **Legal Considerations:** Tools like this can easily be interpreted as malicious by legal authorities, especially if used against real phishing sites without authorization. Ensure you have explicit permission from any target site owner before use.
3. **Repository Hosting:** If you host this on platforms like GitHub, be aware that they have strict policies against hosting malicious code. You may need to include even stronger disclaimers or restrict access to avoid takedowns or account bans.
4. **Improvements:** Consider adding features like rate-limiting, proxy support, or response analysis to make it more useful for legitimate security testing.

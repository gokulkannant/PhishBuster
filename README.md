# Phishhunter

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains a Python-based tool designed for **ethical security research** to simulate the automated submission of randomly generated usernames and passwords to a specified web form.  

The credentials are generated using the `Faker` library, providing **realistic but fictitious** user data. This tool can help security professionals **test phishing site resilience, analyze automated credential submission behaviors, and demonstrate credential-stuffing risks** in a controlled, ethical environment.  

## ⚡ Features  
✅ **Automated Credential Generation** – Uses the `Faker` library to generate usernames and passwords with custom parameters.  
✅ **Automated Form Submission** – Continuously submits credentials to a specified URL.  
✅ **Customizable Submission Rate** – Configure the number of login attempts per minute.  
✅ **Logging Support** – Stores submission attempts and responses for analysis (optional).  

## 🔬 Intended Use  
This tool is intended **strictly for ethical security research and educational purposes** under the following conditions:  
✔️ You have **explicit authorization** to test the target system.  
✔️ You are conducting research within a **legal and ethical** framework.  
✔️ The tool is used **only in controlled, research-approved environments**.
